# Tasty Bites

## Description

Tasty Bites is a website that allows users to search for recipes in a variety of ways including: 
- Searching by name
- searching by ingredient
- searching for random recipes with the ability to apply filters to narrow results.

Responsive design for use on Mobile or Desktop media. 

I used TypeScript, React and TailwindCSS to build this project as a way to familiarize myself with Tailwind. The back-end is The spoonacular Recipe - Food - Nutrition API found on [rapidapi.com](https://rapidapi.com/spoonacular/api/recipe-food-nutrition/). Occasionally the API will return some funky data, luckily it isn't very common but it can happen and I didn't have a great way to detect / filter out potential inconsistencies. 

# Future Improvements

I'd like to add a back-end service for authorization to allow users to create a profile and save recipes so they may come back and access ones they liked. I'll also look into creating re-usable Tailwind classes as I realized a bit late that is a better practice, reducing repeated code and resulting in much more readable code than long lists of class names on elements. Additional improvements will be stylistic updates for UX improvement.

# Run Locally

To run locally, just clone down the project and run "npm start" nothing fancy!
